# Ztor - Tor Network Integration and IP Rotation Tool

Ztor is a versatile and easy-to-use tool designed for seamless integration with the Tor network. By routing your traffic through the Tor network, Ztor helps enhance your online privacy and anonymity, offering advanced features for users who require heightened security. 

## Features:
- **Automatic IP Rotation:** Automatically change your IP address by connecting to different Tor nodes, ensuring constant anonymity.
- **SOCKS5 Proxy Support:** Use Tor as a SOCKS5 proxy for routing internet traffic securely through the Tor network.
- **Easy Configuration:** Simple setup for integrating Tor with various applications and tools.
- **Privacy and Security:** Protects your identity by obfuscating your IP address, encrypting your connection, and anonymizing your browsing activity.

## Installation:
1. Install Tor on your system (Linux, macOS, Windows).
2. Clone or download the Ztor repository.
3. Configure your environment to work with Tor’s SOCKS5 proxy (127.0.0.1:9050).
4. Use Ztor to manage automatic IP rotation and secure browsing.

## How It Works:
Ztor uses Tor's relay network to anonymize internet traffic. By changing your exit node regularly, it helps obscure your real IP address, making it difficult for any online service to track your browsing activities. This makes Ztor an ideal solution for those concerned with maintaining privacy on the internet.

## Requirements:
- Tor installed and running.
- Python 3.x and required dependencies.
- Basic understanding of Tor’s SOCKS5 proxy functionality.
